  "keyword": "API design",
  "explanation": "## API design\n\nAPI design refers to the process of defining the methods and data formats that applications use to communicate with each other. A well-designed API allows for seamless interaction between different software components, ensuring that they can effectively perform operations such as data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of designing a ticket booking service like Ticketmaster, API design is crucial as it defines how clients (e.g., web or mobile applications) interact with the backend services. The APIs facilitate essential functionalities such as **booking tickets**, **viewing events**, and **searching for events**, ensuring that these operations are performed reliably and efficiently.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Functional Requirements**: Focus on what the system should do, including **booking tickets**, **viewing events**, and **searching for events**.\n- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Address system qualities like **scalability**, **fault tolerance**, and **consistency vs. availability**.\n- **Core Entities**: Include **Event**, **Venue**, **Performer**, and **Ticket**, which represent the main components of the system.\n- **API Endpoints**: Examples include **GET /events/:id**, **GET /search**, **POST /reserve**, and **PUT /confirm**, which enable various operations.\n- **High-Level Design**: Utilizes a **microservices architecture** and an **API Gateway** for managing requests and routing.\n- **Scalability Strategies**: Involve **load balancing**, **caching**, and **eventual consistency techniques** to handle high traffic and ensure reliability.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Client Application] -->|Requests| B[API Gateway]\n    B -->|GET /events/:id| C[Event Service]\n    B -->|GET /search| D[Search Service]\n    B -->|POST /reserve| E[Reservation Service]\n    E -->|PUT /confirm| F[Payment Service]\n    C -->|Database Query| G[Event Database]\n    D -->|Database Query| H[Search Database]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\n// Example of a simple API endpoint using Express.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = 3000;\n\n// Sample data\nconst events = [\n    { id: 1, name: \"Concert\", venue: \"Stadium\", date: \"2023-10-01\" },\n    { id: 2, name: \"Theater\", venue: \"Opera House\", date: \"2023-11-10\" }\n];\n\n// GET /events/:id endpoint\napp.get('/events/:id', (req, res) => {\n    const eventId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n    const event = events.find(e => e.id === eventId);\n    if (event) {\n        res.json(event);\n    } else {\n        res.status(404).send('Event not found');\n    }\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);\n});\n``` \n\nThis response provides a clear understanding of API design, its relevance in the context of the ticket booking service, and a structured overview of the key concepts involved in system design. The diagram and code example further illustrate the practical aspects of API interactions.",
