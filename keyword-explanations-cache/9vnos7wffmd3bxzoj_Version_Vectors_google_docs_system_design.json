  "explanation": "## Version Vectors\n\nVersion vectors are a data structure used in distributed systems to track the version of data across multiple nodes, allowing for the detection of conflicts and the management of updates. Each node maintains a vector that records the number of updates it has made, enabling it to identify the causal relationships between different versions of data.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of a real-time collaborative text editor, version vectors help manage concurrent edits by allowing clients to track and discard duplicate operations. They ensure that updates from different users are applied in a consistent manner, even when changes are propagated asynchronously, thus supporting the system's overall goal of maintaining document consistency and integrity.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Version Vectors** are essential for tracking unique operations in a distributed system, preventing redundant processing of updates.\n- **Operational Transformation (OT)** and **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** are techniques that utilize version vectors to resolve conflicts in real-time collaboration.\n- **WebSockets** are used for real-time communication, enabling the efficient propagation of updates alongside version vectors.\n- **Document Snapshots** are managed using version vectors to optimize the retrieval of the current state for new editors joining the collaboration.\n- **Offline Support** relies on version vectors to synchronize changes once a client reconnects, ensuring that all updates are accounted for.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class VersionVector {\n        +Map<String, Integer> vector\n        +increment(nodeId: String)\n        +merge(other: VersionVector)\n        +isConcurrent(other: VersionVector): Boolean\n    }\n\n    class Client {\n        +String clientId\n        +VersionVector versionVector\n        +applyUpdate(update: Update)\n    }\n\n    class Update {\n        +String operation\n        +VersionVector versionVector\n    }\n\n    Client --> VersionVector : maintains\n    Update --> VersionVector : references\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\nclass VersionVector {\n    constructor() {\n        this.vector = new Map();\n    }\n\n    increment(nodeId) {\n        this.vector.set(nodeId, (this.vector.get(nodeId) || 0) + 1);\n    }\n\n    merge(other) {\n        for (const [nodeId, version] of other.vector.entries()) {\n            this.vector.set(nodeId, Math.max(this.vector.get(nodeId) || 0, version));\n        }\n    }\n\n    isConcurrent(other) {\n        let isLessThan = false;\n        let isGreaterThan = false;\n\n        for (const [nodeId, version] of this.vector.entries()) {\n            if (version < (other.vector.get(nodeId) || 0)) {\n                isLessThan = true;\n            } else if (version > (other.vector.get(nodeId) || 0)) {\n                isGreaterThan = true;\n            }\n        }\n        return isLessThan && isGreaterThan;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis explanation and accompanying materials provide a foundational understanding of version vectors and their critical role in real-time collaborative systems.",
