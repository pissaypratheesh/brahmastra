  "explanation": "## code-editor\n\nA **code editor** is a software application designed for editing source code of computer programs. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools, which enhance the programming experience and improve productivity. Code editors can be standalone applications or integrated into larger development environments.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of financial systems, a code editor is essential for developers working on system design, such as digital wallets, payment systems, and stock trading applications. It allows them to write, test, and debug code efficiently, ensuring that complex algorithms and data structures are implemented correctly to handle financial transactions securely and reliably.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database management system used for storing financial data.\n- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services, a cloud platform that provides infrastructure for scalable financial applications.\n- **Saga pattern**: A design pattern for managing distributed transactions across multiple services.\n- **ACID properties**: Ensures that transactions are processed reliably in financial systems.\n- **Database indexing**: Improves query performance for retrieving financial data efficiently.\n- **2-phase-commit**: A protocol used to ensure all parts of a transaction are completed successfully.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Code Editor] --> B[Syntax Highlighting]\n    A --> C[Code Completion]\n    A --> D[Debugging Tools]\n    A --> E[Version Control Integration]\n    B --> F[Improved Readability]\n    C --> G[Increased Productivity]\n    D --> H[Error Identification]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\n// Example of a simple function in a code editor that calculates the total amount after a transaction\nfunction calculateTotal(amount, fee) {\n    if (amount < 0 || fee < 0) {\n        throw new Error(\"Amount and fee must be non-negative\");\n    }\n    return amount + fee;\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst total = calculateTotal(100, 2.5);\nconsole.log(`Total amount after fee: $${total}`); // Output: Total amount after fee: $102.5\n```",
