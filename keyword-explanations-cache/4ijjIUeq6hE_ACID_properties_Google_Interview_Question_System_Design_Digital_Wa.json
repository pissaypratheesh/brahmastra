  "explanation": "## ACID properties\n\nACID properties refer to a set of principles that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. The acronym stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure that transactions are processed reliably, maintaining the integrity of the database even in the event of failures or errors.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of the digital wallet system, ACID properties are crucial for ensuring that financial transactions are executed correctly and consistently. For instance, Atomicity ensures that a transaction either fully completes or has no effect at all, which is vital when transferring funds between users. Consistency guarantees that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction, while Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Finally, Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the case of system failures. This is particularly important in a high-volume environment like a digital wallet handling millions of transactions per second.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Transaction] -->|1. Begin| B[Atomicity]\n    B -->|2. Complete or Rollback| C[Consistency]\n    C -->|3. Valid State| D[Isolation]\n    D -->|4. Concurrent Transactions| E[Durability]\n    E -->|5. Persisted Data| F[End Transaction]\n```\n\nThis diagram illustrates the flow of a transaction through the ACID properties, emphasizing how each property contributes to the overall integrity and reliability of the transaction process in a digital wallet system.",
