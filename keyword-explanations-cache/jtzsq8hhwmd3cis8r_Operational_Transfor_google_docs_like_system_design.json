  "explanation": "## Operational Transformation\n\nOperational Transformation (OT) is a technique used in real-time collaborative applications to ensure consistency among multiple users editing the same document simultaneously. It works by transforming operations based on their context and order, allowing users' edits to be reconciled and reflected across all clients in a consistent manner.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of designing a real-time collaborative text editor, OT is crucial for resolving conflicts that arise when multiple users make edits concurrently. It ensures that all users see a consistent view of the document, regardless of the order in which their edits are applied, thus facilitating seamless collaboration similar to platforms like Google Docs.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Enables multiple users to edit documents simultaneously without conflicts.\n- **Operational Transformation (OT)**: Transforms operations to maintain consistency across different user views.\n- **WebSockets**: Provides a persistent connection for real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.\n- **Version Management**: Techniques like **Merkle Trees** and **Version Vectors** are used to track document changes efficiently.\n- **Offline Support**: Mechanisms to allow editing without an internet connection, with synchronization upon reconnection.\n- **Conflict Resolution**: OT and **CRDTs** are key strategies for managing concurrent edits and ensuring data integrity.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User1 as User 1\n    participant User2 as User 2\n    participant Server as WebSocket Server\n    User1->>Server: Edit Operation A\n    Server->>User2: Transform Operation A\n    User2->>Server: Edit Operation B\n    Server->>User1: Transform Operation B\n    User1->>Server: Final Document State\n    Server->>User1: Sync Final State\n    Server->>User2: Sync Final State\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\nfunction applyOperation(document, operation) {\n    // Example operation: { type: 'insert', position: 5, text: 'Hello' }\n    switch (operation.type) {\n        case 'insert':\n            return document.slice(0, operation.position) + operation.text + document.slice(operation.position);\n        case 'delete':\n            return document.slice(0, operation.position) + document.slice(operation.position + operation.length);\n        default:\n            throw new Error('Unknown operation type');\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet document = \"This is a sample text.\";\nlet operation = { type: 'insert', position: 10, text: ' collaborative' };\nlet newDocument = applyOperation(document, operation);\nconsole.log(newDocument); // Output: \"This is a collaborative sample text.\"\n``` \n\nThis code snippet demonstrates a simple function that applies an edit operation to a document, illustrating the concept of operational transformation in practice.",
