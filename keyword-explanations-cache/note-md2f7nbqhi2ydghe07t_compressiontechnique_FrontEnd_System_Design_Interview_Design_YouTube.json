  "explanation": "## compression-techniques\n\nCompression techniques are methods used to reduce the size of data to save storage space and decrease transmission time over networks. These techniques can be categorized into two main types: lossless compression, which allows for the original data to be perfectly reconstructed, and lossy compression, which sacrifices some data fidelity for greater size reduction.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of designing a YouTube-like application, **compression techniques** are essential for optimizing performance and enhancing user experience. By implementing methods like **gzip** or **Brotli** compression for static assets, the application can significantly reduce load times, which is crucial for maintaining user engagement and ensuring smooth video playback.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Video Uploading and Searching:** Users can upload videos with **metadata** and search through **titles**.\n- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Emphasis on **performance**, **scalability**, and **responsiveness** for a wide audience.\n- **API Design:** Use of **RESTful API** endpoints for functionalities like **video upload**, **search**, and **user interactions**.\n- **Scalability Strategies:** Implementation of **caching**, **CDN**, and **compression techniques** to improve asset distribution and load times.\n- **Failure Handling Mechanisms:** Ensuring **graceful degradation** and effective **error logging** for a reliable user experience.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Compression Techniques] -->|Reduces Size| B[Static Assets]\n    A -->|Improves Load Times| C[User Experience]\n    B --> D[HTTP/2]\n    B --> E[CDN]\n    C --> F[Video Playback]\n    C --> G[Page Load Speed]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\n// Example of using compression middleware in an Express.js application\nconst express = require('express');\nconst compression = require('compression');\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Use compression middleware\napp.use(compression());\n\n// Serve static files\napp.use(express.static('public'));\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');\n});\n```\n\nThis response provides a clear and concise overview of compression techniques, their relevance to the context of a video streaming application, a summary of key concepts, a Mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships, and a practical JavaScript code example for implementing compression in a web server.",
