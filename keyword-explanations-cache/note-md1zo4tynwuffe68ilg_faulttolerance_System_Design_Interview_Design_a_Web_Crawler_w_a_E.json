  "keyword": "fault-tolerance",
  "explanation": "## fault-tolerance\n\nFault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating correctly in the event of a failure of some of its components. This is achieved through redundancy, error detection, and recovery mechanisms, ensuring that the system can recover from faults without significant disruption to its services.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of designing a **web crawler**, fault tolerance is crucial to ensure that the crawler can handle failures such as network issues or server downtime while maintaining progress and data integrity. By implementing retry mechanisms and backup systems, the crawler can recover from errors and continue processing without losing previously gathered data.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- The **web crawler** must efficiently extract **text data** from up to **10 billion web pages** within a strict **five-day** operational limit.\n- It requires robust **fault tolerance** to handle failures and ensure data integrity, incorporating **retry mechanisms** and **backup systems**.\n- The crawler must adhere to **robots.txt** directives for **politeness** and avoid overwhelming servers.\n- The design should be **scalable**, allowing it to handle varying loads, potentially using a **microservices architecture**.\n- **Efficiency** is key, necessitating optimization strategies like **concurrency** and **load balancing**.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Web Crawler] -->|Initiates| B[Seed URLs]\n    B --> C[Extract Text Data]\n    C --> D[Store Data]\n    D --> E[Deduplication]\n    E --> F[Handle Failures]\n    F -->|Retry| C\n    F -->|Backup| D\n    F -->|Log Error| G[Error Handling]\n    G --> H[Monitor System Health]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\nasync function fetchWithRetry(url, retries = 3) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {\n        try {\n            const response = await fetch(url);\n            if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n            return await response.text();\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error(`Attempt ${i + 1} failed: ${error.message}`);\n            if (i === retries - 1) throw error; // Rethrow if last attempt fails\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
