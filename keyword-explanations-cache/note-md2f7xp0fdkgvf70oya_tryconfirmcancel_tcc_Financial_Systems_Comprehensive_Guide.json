  "explanation": "## try-confirm-cancel (tc/c)\n\nThe \"try-confirm-cancel\" (tc/c) pattern is a transaction management approach used in distributed systems to ensure that operations can be completed reliably and without inconsistency. It involves three phases: **try**, where the system attempts to execute an operation and reserves resources; **confirm**, where the operation is finalized and committed; and **cancel**, which is invoked if the operation cannot be completed, allowing the system to roll back any changes made during the try phase.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of financial systems, such as payment processing or digital wallets, the tc/c pattern is crucial for maintaining the **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of transactions. It helps prevent issues like double spending and ensures that transactions are either fully completed or rolled back, thus preserving the integrity of financial data.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Try-Confirm-Cancel (tc/c)** pattern is essential for reliable transaction management in **distributed systems**.\n- It consists of three phases: **try**, **confirm**, and **cancel**, ensuring that operations are either fully completed or rolled back.\n- Relevant to **financial systems** where maintaining **ACID properties** is critical to prevent inconsistencies.\n- Related concepts include **transaction isolation**, **2-phase commit**, and **item potency**.\n- The pattern is often used alongside other design patterns like the **Saga pattern** for managing complex transactions across microservices.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start Transaction] --> B[Try Phase]\n    B --> C{Success?}\n    C -- Yes --> D[Confirm Phase]\n    C -- No --> E[Cancel Phase]\n    D --> F[Transaction Committed]\n    E --> G[Rollback Changes]\n    F --> H[End Transaction]\n    G --> H\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\nasync function tryConfirmCancel(transaction) {\n    try {\n        // Try Phase: Attempt to reserve resources or perform operation\n        await tryPhase(transaction);\n\n        // Confirm Phase: Finalize the transaction\n        await confirmPhase(transaction);\n        console.log(\"Transaction committed successfully.\");\n    } catch (error) {\n        // Cancel Phase: Rollback changes if an error occurs\n        await cancelPhase(transaction);\n        console.error(\"Transaction failed, changes rolled back:\", error);\n    }\n}\n\nasync function tryPhase(transaction) {\n    // Logic to reserve resources or perform initial checks\n}\n\nasync function confirmPhase(transaction) {\n    // Logic to finalize the transaction\n}\n\nasync function cancelPhase(transaction) {\n    // Logic to rollback any changes made during the try phase\n}\n``` \n\nThis explanation and the accompanying diagram and code example provide a clear understanding of the try-confirm-cancel pattern and its relevance in the context of financial systems.",
