  "explanation": "## Version History\n\nVersion history is a mechanism for tracking and managing changes made to a document over time. It allows users to view, revert, and manage different states of the document, ensuring that all edits are recorded and can be accessed or restored as needed.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of a real-time collaborative text editor, version history is crucial for maintaining consistency and providing users with the ability to track changes made by themselves or others. It supports the implementation of features like undo/redo, document snapshots, and conflict resolution, which are essential for a seamless collaborative experience.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Version History**: Tracks document changes over time, enabling users to view and revert to previous states.\n- **Operational Transformation (OT)**: A technique used to manage concurrent edits and maintain document consistency in real-time collaboration.\n- **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: Data structures that help resolve conflicts in distributed systems, ensuring eventual consistency.\n- **WebSockets**: A protocol facilitating real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, essential for collaborative editing.\n- **Document Snapshots**: Initial states of the document that are crucial for new editors to access the current version and changes efficiently.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngitGraph\n    commit id: \"Initial Version\"\n    commit id: \"Edit 1\"\n    commit id: \"Edit 2\"\n    branch feature\n    commit id: \"Feature Edit 1\"\n    commit id: \"Feature Edit 2\"\n    checkout main\n    merge feature\n    commit id: \"Final Version\"\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\nclass VersionHistory {\n    constructor() {\n        this.versions = [];\n    }\n\n    addVersion(documentState) {\n        this.versions.push(documentState);\n    }\n\n    getVersion(index) {\n        return this.versions[index];\n    }\n\n    getLatestVersion() {\n        return this.versions[this.versions.length - 1];\n    }\n\n    revertToVersion(index) {\n        if (index >= 0 && index < this.versions.length) {\n            return this.versions[index];\n        }\n        throw new Error(\"Invalid version index\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst history = new VersionHistory();\nhistory.addVersion(\"Version 1: Initial content\");\nhistory.addVersion(\"Version 2: Added more text\");\nconsole.log(history.getLatestVersion()); // Output: \"Version 2: Added more text\"\nconsole.log(history.revertToVersion(0)); // Output: \"Version 1: Initial content\"\n```",
