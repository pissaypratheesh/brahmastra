  "explanation": "## streaming-media\n\nStreaming media refers to the continuous transmission of audio and video files over the internet, allowing users to access content in real-time without needing to download the entire file first. This technology enables instant playback, making it possible for users to watch or listen to content as it is being delivered.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of designing a ticket booking service like Ticketmaster, streaming media can be relevant for delivering live event broadcasts, promotional video content, or real-time updates about events. It enhances user engagement and provides a richer experience by allowing users to preview events or receive live updates during ticket sales.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Functional Requirements**: The system must support **booking tickets**, **viewing events**, and **searching for events** efficiently.\n- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Emphasizes the need for **scalability**, **fault tolerance**, and a balance between **consistency** and **availability**.\n- **Core Entities**: Key components include **Event**, **Venue**, **Performer**, and **Ticket**, each with specific attributes.\n- **API Design**: Essential endpoints like **GET /events/:id** and **POST /reserve** facilitate interaction with the system.\n- **High-Level Design**: Utilizes a **Microservices Architecture** and an **API Gateway** to manage requests and services effectively.\n- **Scalability Strategies**: Incorporates techniques such as **load balancing**, **caching**, and **eventual consistency** to handle high traffic.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User Interface] -->|Requests| B[API Gateway]\n    B -->|Routes to| C[Event CRUD Service]\n    B -->|Routes to| D[Ticket Service]\n    C -->|Reads/Writes| E[(Database)]\n    D -->|Reads/Writes| E\n    E -->|Stores| F[Event Data]\n    E -->|Stores| G[Ticket Data]\n    E -->|Stores| H[Venue Data]\n    E -->|Stores| I[Performer Data]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\n// Example of a simple API endpoint for reserving tickets\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\n\nlet tickets = [\n    { id: 1, eventId: 1, status: 'available' },\n    { id: 2, eventId: 1, status: 'available' },\n];\n\napp.post('/reserve', (req, res) => {\n    const { ticketId } = req.body;\n    const ticket = tickets.find(t => t.id === ticketId);\n    \n    if (ticket && ticket.status === 'available') {\n        ticket.status = 'reserved';\n        res.status(200).send({ message: 'Ticket reserved successfully', ticket });\n    } else {\n        res.status(400).send({ message: 'Ticket not available' });\n    }\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n});\n```",
