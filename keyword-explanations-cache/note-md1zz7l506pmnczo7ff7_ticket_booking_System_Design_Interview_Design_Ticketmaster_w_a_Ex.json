  "explanation": "## Ticket Booking\n\nTicket booking is the process through which users reserve and purchase tickets for events such as concerts, sports, or theater performances. This system typically involves selecting an event, viewing available seating options, and completing a transaction to secure the tickets.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of designing a ticket booking service similar to Ticketmaster, the focus is on creating a robust system that efficiently handles user requests for booking tickets, viewing events, and ensuring data consistency to prevent issues like double bookings. The design process emphasizes understanding both **functional** and **non-functional requirements**, defining core entities, and implementing a scalable architecture.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Functional Requirements** include **booking tickets**, **viewing events**, and **searching for events**.\n- **Non-Functional Requirements** address **consistency vs. availability**, **scalability**, and **fault tolerance**.\n- Core entities such as **Event**, **Venue**, **Performer**, and **Ticket** are essential for structuring the system.\n- API Design includes endpoints for **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** operations to manage event and ticket data.\n- The **High-Level Design** utilizes a **microservices architecture** and an **API Gateway** for efficient request handling.\n- Scalability strategies involve **load balancing**, **caching**, and **eventual consistency techniques** to manage high traffic.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User] -->|Search Events| B[API Gateway]\n    B -->|GET /search| C[Event Service]\n    C -->|Return Event List| B\n    B -->|GET /events/:id| D[Event Details]\n    D -->|View Event| E[Ticket Service]\n    E -->|GET /tickets| F[Available Tickets]\n    F -->|Display Tickets| D\n    D -->|Reserve Ticket| G[Reservation Service]\n    G -->|POST /reserve| H[Payment Gateway]\n    H -->|Confirm Payment| I[Confirmation]\n    I -->|Complete Booking| J[User]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\n// Example of a simple ticket reservation function in JavaScript\nasync function reserveTicket(eventId, userId, ticketId) {\n    try {\n        // Step 1: Reserve the ticket\n        const reserveResponse = await fetch(`/reserve`, {\n            method: 'POST',\n            headers: {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n            },\n            body: JSON.stringify({ eventId, userId, ticketId }),\n        });\n\n        if (!reserveResponse.ok) {\n            throw new Error('Failed to reserve ticket');\n        }\n\n        // Step 2: Confirm the reservation\n        const paymentResponse = await fetch(`/confirm`, {\n            method: 'PUT',\n            headers: {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n            },\n            body: JSON.stringify({ userId, ticketId }),\n        });\n\n        if (!paymentResponse.ok) {\n            throw new Error('Payment confirmation failed');\n        }\n\n        const result = await paymentResponse.json();\n        console.log('Ticket booked successfully:', result);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error during ticket booking:', error);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis response provides a clear explanation of ticket booking, contextual relevance, a summary of key concepts, a Mermaid diagram illustrating the system flow, and a JavaScript code example for reserving tickets.",
