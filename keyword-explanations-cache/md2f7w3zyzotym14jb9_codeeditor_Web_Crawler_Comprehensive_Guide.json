  "explanation": "## code-editor\n\nA **code editor** is a software application designed for writing and editing source code. It typically includes features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools, which enhance the coding experience and improve developer productivity.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of web development and system design, a **code editor** is essential for building applications like web crawlers and WYSIWYG editors. It serves as the primary tool for developers to write, test, and debug their code effectively, facilitating the implementation of complex algorithms and data structures discussed in the various system design interviews.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- A **code editor** provides an interface for developers to write and edit code efficiently.\n- It often includes features like **syntax highlighting** and **code completion** to enhance productivity.\n- The design of applications such as **WYSIWYG editors** and **web crawlers** relies heavily on the capabilities of modern code editors.\n- Understanding how to utilize a code editor effectively is crucial for successful **system design** and development.\n- Key technical concepts discussed include **microservices**, **REST APIs**, and **frontend system design**.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Code Editor] --> B[Syntax Highlighting]\n    A --> C[Code Completion]\n    A --> D[Debugging Tools]\n    A --> E[Version Control Integration]\n    B --> F[Improved Readability]\n    C --> G[Increased Productivity]\n    D --> H[Error Detection]\n    E --> I[Collaboration]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\n// Simple code snippet to demonstrate a basic JavaScript function in a code editor\nfunction greet(name) {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n}\n\n// Calling the function\ngreet('World'); // Output: Hello, World!\n```",
