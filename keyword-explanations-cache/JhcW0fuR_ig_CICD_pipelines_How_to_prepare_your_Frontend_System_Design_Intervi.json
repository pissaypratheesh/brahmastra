  "explanation": "## CI/CD pipelines\n\nCI/CD pipelines refer to a set of automated processes that enable software development teams to integrate code changes (Continuous Integration - CI) and deliver those changes to production (Continuous Deployment - CD) efficiently and reliably. This approach minimizes manual intervention, reduces errors, and accelerates the feedback loop, allowing teams to release software updates more frequently and with higher quality.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the context of designing a platform similar to LeetCode, CI/CD pipelines are crucial for ensuring that new features, bug fixes, and improvements can be integrated and deployed seamlessly. By automating the testing and deployment processes, the development team can maintain high code quality and respond quickly to user feedback or system requirements, which is essential for a competitive coding platform that may experience high traffic during competitions.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- **Functional Requirements** include user interactions such as viewing and selecting **coding problems**, submitting **solutions**, and participating in **coding competitions**.\n- **Non-Functional Requirements** emphasize system qualities like **availability**, **security**, and the ability to support up to **100,000 users** simultaneously.\n- The design incorporates **APIs** for user interactions, including **GET** requests for problem lists and **POST** requests for submissions.\n- **High-Level Design (HLD)** suggests starting with a **monolithic architecture** and considering **microservices** for scalability.\n- **Security** measures involve isolating user code execution using **Docker containers** to prevent malicious code execution.\n- **CI/CD pipelines** facilitate continuous integration and deployment, ensuring smooth transitions from development to production.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Developer Code] -->|Push to Repository| B[Version Control System]\n    B -->|Trigger CI Pipeline| C[Automated Tests]\n    C -->|Pass| D[Build Artifacts]\n    C -->|Fail| E[Notify Developers]\n    D -->|Deploy to Staging| F[Staging Environment]\n    F -->|Manual Approval| G[Production Deployment]\n    G -->|Deploy to Production| H[Live Application]\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\n// Example of a simple CI script using Node.js and Jest for testing\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\n\nexec('npm test', (error, stdout, stderr) => {\n    if (error) {\n        console.error(`Error executing tests: ${error.message}`);\n        return;\n    }\n    if (stderr) {\n        console.error(`Test errors: ${stderr}`);\n        return;\n    }\n    console.log(`Test results:\\n${stdout}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates a basic Continuous Integration script that runs tests using the Jest framework. It executes the tests and logs the results, providing feedback on the code quality before deployment.",
