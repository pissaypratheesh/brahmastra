  "explanation": "## progress-components\n\n\"Progress-components\" refer to the modular elements within a user interface that reflect the current state of a process or task, often providing visual feedback to users. In the context of a spreadsheet application, these components can represent the status of calculations, data loading, or user interactions, enhancing user experience by indicating progress and responsiveness.\n\n### How it applies in this context:\nIn the design of a Google Sheets-like application, **progress-components** are essential for managing user expectations during operations such as **formula parsing**, **state updates**, and **data rendering**. They can indicate when calculations are being performed or when data is being loaded, ensuring that users remain informed and engaged, especially during potentially long-running operations.\n\n### Summary Breakdown:\n- The application aims to implement a **spreadsheet** with basic **formatting** and **formula parsing** capabilities.\n- The choice of **DOM rendering** over **canvas** is based on development simplicity and accessibility considerations.\n- **Virtualization** techniques are employed to optimize performance for large datasets, dynamically loading elements based on viewport constraints.\n- **Dependency resolution** is managed using directed acyclic graphs and **topological sorting** to ensure correct calculation sequences.\n- **State management** utilizes a flattened map structure to track cell attributes and trigger recalculations efficiently.\n- **Accessibility** is prioritized through adherence to **HTML5** standards and the implementation of ARIA roles for assistive technologies.\n\n### Diagram:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User Interaction] --> B[Progress-Components]\n    B --> C[Loading Indicator]\n    B --> D[Calculation Status]\n    B --> E[Data Sync Status]\n    C --> F[Display Loading Animation]\n    D --> G[Show Calculation Progress]\n    E --> H[Display Sync Status]\n    F --> I[User Feedback]\n    G --> I\n    H --> I\n```\n\n### Code Example (if applicable):\n```javascript\nclass ProgressComponent {\n    constructor() {\n        this.loading = false;\n        this.calculationStatus = '';\n        this.syncStatus = '';\n    }\n\n    startLoading() {\n        this.loading = true;\n        this.updateUI();\n    }\n\n    stopLoading() {\n        this.loading = false;\n        this.updateUI();\n    }\n\n    setCalculationStatus(status) {\n        this.calculationStatus = status;\n        this.updateUI();\n    }\n\n    setSyncStatus(status) {\n        this.syncStatus = status;\n        this.updateUI();\n    }\n\n    updateUI() {\n        // Update the UI based on the current state of loading, calculation, and sync status\n        console.log(`Loading: ${this.loading}, Calculation: ${this.calculationStatus}, Sync: ${this.syncStatus}`);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst progress = new ProgressComponent();\nprogress.startLoading();\nprogress.setCalculationStatus('Calculating...');\nsetTimeout(() => {\n    progress.setCalculationStatus('Completed');\n    progress.stopLoading();\n}, 2000);\n``` \n\nThis code provides a simple implementation of a **progress component** that tracks loading and calculation statuses, updating the UI accordingly.",
