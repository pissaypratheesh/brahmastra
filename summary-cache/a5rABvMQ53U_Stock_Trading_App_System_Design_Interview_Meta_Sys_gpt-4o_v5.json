The video aims to demonstrate how candidates should approach open-ended system design problems, structuring their thoughts, making design trade-offs, and responding to follow-up questions. This session provides insights into what tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon look for in their system design interviews.\n\n### Detailed Technical Content\n\n#### System Design of a Stock Broker Platform\n\n- **Problem Statement**: Design a stock broker platform similar to Zerodha or Upstox, focusing on transactions between users and stock exchanges.\n  \n- **Functional Requirements**:\n  1. Users can place buy/sell orders.\n  2. Support for both limit and market orders.\n  3. Real-time stock price visibility for users.\n  4. Populate user screens with today's entire stock data when first accessed.\n  \n- **Non-Functional Requirements**:\n  1. High consistency for order placements.\n  2. High availability for stock price visibility.\n  3. Scalability to handle a high number of concurrent requests.\n\n- **Traffic Estimation**:\n  - For a system with 100 million users, assuming 10 million daily active users, derive expected QPS based on user activities like viewing stock prices and placing orders.\n\n#### High-Level Design (HLD)\n\n1. **Architecture Components**:\n   - **API Gateway**: Handles rate limiting, authentication, and fraud checks.\n   - **Price Service**: Manages real-time stock prices via server-sent events.\n   - **Order Management System (OMS)**: Manages customer orders, ensuring placement and maintaining order history.\n   - **Exchange Gateway Processor**: Interfaces with the stock exchange for order placement and receptions of updates.\n\n2. **Data Flow**:\n   - **User requests** go through API Gateway to OMS for order placements.\n   - **Price updates** are fetched from the exchange by Price Service and relayed back to users.\n   - **Order updates** are queued through Kafka for more linear order processing before interfacing with the exchange.\n\n3. **Scalability Solutions**:\n   - **Sharding**: Orders and historical data are sharded to balance load evenly based on user ID.\n   - **Streaming Platforms**: Implement Kafka for asynchronously queuing orders, reducing direct load on the database and exchange.\n\n#### Low-Level Design (LLD)\n\n1. **Database Schema**:\n   - **Order DB**: Tracks user orders with fields like order ID, user ID, symbol, status, and timestamp.\n   - **Time-Series DB**: Utilizes Timescale or equivalent for storing time-based stock ticks.\n\n2. **Communication Protocols**:\n   - **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Opted for lightweight one-way communication for real-time price updates.\n   - **WebSockets**: Avoided due to unnecessary bidirectional overhead in this specific use-case.\n\n3. **Failure Handling**:\n   - **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retries with dead-letter queues for orders failing to secure an exchange ID.\n   - **Fallback Storage**: Maintain historic data to ensure availability even if real-time data is delayed.\n\n#### Optimization Techniques\n\n1. **Reducing Latency**:\n   - **Data Center Proximity**: Deploy infrastructure close to exchange servers to reduce latency due to physical distance.\n   - **Direct Connections**: Engage more wired, direct connections with the exchange datasets where possible.\n\n2. **Load Management**:\n   - **Hybrid Load Balancing**: Mix pre-provisioned and autoscaled instances to accommodate peak loads.\n   - **Region-Specific Deployment**: Tailor server provisioning to high-traffic regions for optimal performance.\n\n3. **Scaling Strategies**:\n   - Utilize a combination of high-capacity instances with distributed load based on usage patterns.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **System design interviews** demand a balance between deep technical knowledge and the ability to justify design decisions.\n- **Traffic estimation and scaling** are critical to meeting non-functional requirements like availability and responsiveness.\n- **Real-time data processing** needs careful architecture choices (e.g., using SSE over WebSockets) based on specific use case demands.\n- Effective **use of databases** can provide both historical data availability and real-time data consistency.\n- **Scalable architecture** through microservices, sharding, and streaming platforms like Kafka provides systems resilience and efficiency.\n- **Incident handling and retries** are embedded into the system for robust order processing, capturing potential fail points seamlessly.",
