Raj Sagar, a UI/Frontend engineer at Flipkart, shares insights into not only implementing an autocomplete feature but also optimizing it for performance and addressing common issues related to UI development such as debounce and throttle, intersection observers, abort controllers, and handling CORS for cross-origin requests. The session highlights critical concepts and best practices for frontend system design, especially useful for candidates preparing for interviews in leading tech companies.\n\n[Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Technical Content\n\n### Scoping Problem Statement\nThe interview begins with setting the context for the autocomplete feature. It is introduced as a low-level design and machine coding round exercise using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The expectations are clear:\n\n- The input should trigger suggestions.\n- It should allow selection from suggestions.\n- It ideally needs to be performant, avoiding unnecessary network calls while being reusable and customizable.\n\nThe goal is to mimic an API call by using hardcoded data.\n\n#### HTML Structure and Data Setup\n1. **HTML Structure**: \n   - The basic skeleton involves an input box and a list element for suggestions. \n   - The initial design focus is on functionality rather than aesthetics, allowing room for creative styling later.\n\n2. **Data Initialization**: \n   - Hardcoded data representing possible suggestions (e.g., a list of fruits) is defined in a separate JavaScript file and is to be exported for use in the main script file that handles the autocomplete logic.\n\n[Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n---\n\n### Developing the Autocomplete Logic\n\n#### Utility Functions and Event Handling\n- The function filters the list of suggestions based on user input. \n- It uses string matching to determine which fruits start with the input string and returns a filtered list.\n- The logic mimics an asynchronous API call using JavaScript's `Promise` to introduce a delay, simulating network latency.\n\n#### Event Listeners and Result Handling\n- An event listener captures input changes and invokes a handler function.\n- The handler function fetches suggestions and displays them as a list.\n\n#### Render Logic\n- Render methods update the DOM by appending suggestion elements under the input.\n- State changes are handled with class-based visibility toggling in CSS.\n- Fragmentation is used to batch DOM updates, improving performance by reducing the number of reflows and repaints.\n\n[Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n---\n\n### Performance and Optimization\n- **Debounce**: A custom debounce function is written to limit how often function calls are executed, minimizing unnecessary API calls and reducing workload. This is achieved by clearing and resetting a timer for each keystroke, only executing if the user ceased typing for a specified delay.\n\n- **Throttle vs. Debounce**: \n  - Throttle limits the executions to once every specified delay regardless of user input frequency.\n  - Debounce delays the function call until after the user stops typing. \n  - Practical implications include user interface fluidity versus responsiveness.\n\n[Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n---\n\n### Handling Advanced Features\n\n#### Intersection Observer for Infinite Scroll\nThe session touches upon enhancing autocomplete with infinite scrolling, using `Intersection Observer`. This API watches elements (like a sentinel) to detect when users scroll to the bottom of a suggestion list to fetch more data on demand.\n\n#### Abort Controller for Managing Requests\n- **AbortController**: Controls ongoing API requests using a signal parameter in fetch calls. If a user types new input before the last request completes, the running request can be canceled by invoking the `abort()` method.\n\n#### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)\nStrategies are",
