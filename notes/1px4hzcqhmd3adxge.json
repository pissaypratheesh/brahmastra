This document provides a comprehensive guide to designing a web crawler, drawing insights from a tutorial by Evan, a former staff engineer at Meta. The guide covers all aspects of system design, from defining requirements to high-level and low-level design, and concludes with strategies for optimization and handling corner cases.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.

This data can be used for various purposes, such as training large language models (LLMs) like OpenAIâ€™s chat models. The crawler must operate efficiently under specific constraints, including time limitations and adherence to web protocols.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **Crawl the Web**: Start from seed URLs and extract/store text data.\n- **Data Extraction**: Efficiently extract relevant text data from web pages.\n\n### Non-functional Requirements\n\n- **Scalability**: Handle up to 10 billion pages.\n- **Efficiency**: Complete the crawling process within a five-day window.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure system reliability and continuity.\n- **Compliance**: Adhere to web scraping norms and policies, such as `robots.txt`.\n\n## High-Level Design (HLD)\n\n### Core Entities and System Interface\n\n- **Core Entities**: Text data, URL metadata, and domain-level metadata.\n- **System Interface**: Inputs are seed URLs; outputs are the crawled and stored text data.\n\n### Data Flow Analysis\n\n1. **Message Queue**: Seed URLs are stored in a message queue (e.g., Kafka or SQS).\n2. **Workers**: Pull URLs, fetch pages via DNS, extract data, and store it.\n3. **Storage**: Extracted text is stored in blob storage (e.g., AWS S3), and discovered URLs are requeued.\n\n### Scalability and Efficiency\n\n- Utilize a distributed architecture to process URLs and page fetches independently.\n- Ensure seamless scaling to handle large volumes of data.\n\n## Low-Level Design (LLD)\n\n### Component Breakdown\n\n- **Frontier Queue**: Manages URLs to be processed.\n- **Crawler Workers**: Fetch HTML content and process data.\n- **Blob Storage**: Stores extracted text data.\n- **Database**: Tracks URL states and metadata to manage process continuity.\n\n### Fault Tolerance Strategies\n\n- Implement automatic retries for failed operations.\n- Use checkpoints and logging to maintain state and diagnose issues.\n\n### Security and Compliance\n\n- Respect `robots.txt` configurations.\n- Implement TLS for secure data transmission.\n\n## Optimization Techniques\n\n### Enhancing Performance\n\n- Distribute workload among multiple worker nodes.\n- Use CDNs and caching strategies to optimize network calls.\n\n### Resource Management\n\n- Leverage cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for elastic scaling.\n- Optimize compute resource usage to minimize costs.\n\n### Robust Failure Handling\n\n- Implement distributed logging and monitoring to detect and manage anomalies.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **System Design Process**: Define requirements, design at high and low levels, and optimize based on non-functional needs.\n- **Pragmatic Considerations**: Address constraints like fault tolerance and politeness for a robust system.\n- **Interview Insights**: Communicate design decisions effectively and engage with interviewers on potential challenges and solutions.\n\nThis guide provides a strategic framework for designing a web crawler, valuable for both system designers and candidates preparing for technical interviews at top tech firms.\n```",
