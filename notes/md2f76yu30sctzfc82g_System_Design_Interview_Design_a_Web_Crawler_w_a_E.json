Evan, a former Meta Staff Engineer and co-founder of Hello Interview, shares his insights on tackling this problem efficiently in an interview setting. It targets aspiring software engineers preparing for interviews, particularly in high-stakes environments like FAANG companies.\n\n**Detailed Technical Content:**\n\n1. **Problem Definition:**\n   - **Goal**: Design a web crawler to extract text data from the web for training a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT.\n   - **Constraints**: The crawler must run for only five days, and efficiently handle up to 10 billion web pages with an average size of 2 MB each.\n   - **Resources**: Assume access to substantial, but reasonable, computational resources.\n\n2. **Functional Requirements:**\n   - Crawl the web starting from seed URLs.\n   - Extract and store text data from these websites.\n\n3. **Non-Functional Requirements:**\n   - **Fault Tolerance**: The system must handle failures robustly to avoid losing progress.\n   - **Politeness**: Adhere to websites' robots.txt files to prevent server overloads.\n   - **Scalability**: Must efficiently scale to handle the vast number of pages.\n   - **Efficiency**: Complete the crawl within the five-day constraint.\n\n4. **System Design Roadmap:**\n   - **Core Entities**:\n     - **Text Data**: The collected data output.\n     - **URL Metadata**: Information regarding crawled or pending URLs.\n     - **Domain Metadata**: For compliance with robots.txt.\n   \n   - **Interface & Data Flow**:\n     - Input: Seed URLs\n     - Output: Parsed text data.\n     - Steps: Resolve URL DNS, fetch pages, extract text/URLs, store text, repeat.\n\n5. **High-Level Design:**\n   - **Queue System**: Frontier queue (e.g., Kafka, SQS) to manage URLs.\n   - **Worker System**: Crawler workers fetch URLs, extract content, and update the queue.\n   - **Storage System**: Use blob storage (e.g., S3) for storing extracted text data.\n\n6. **Deep Dives:**\n   - **Enhancing Fault Tolerance**: Split responsibilities for improved fault isolation and scalability.\n   - **Politeness System**: Implement checks against robots.txt to pace crawling.\n   - **Scalability Optimizations**: Ensure system supports the scale of web pages efficiently.\n   - **Efficient Operation**: Fine-tune operations to meet the five-day constraint.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- A structured approach to system design interviews leads to clearer communication and solutions.\n- Both functional and non-functional requirements play crucial roles in shaping the architecture.\n- Modularizing tasks enhances fault tolerance and scalability.\n- Understanding the problemâ€™s constraints allows for targeted optimization.\n- Engaging with interviewers to clarify requirements can refine the design process.",
