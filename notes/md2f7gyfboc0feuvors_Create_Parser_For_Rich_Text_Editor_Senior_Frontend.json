The task is to take a string with specified markup data and produce a properly formatted HTML string. The parser intelligently wraps text segments with HTML tags based on given indices.\n\n### Detailed Technical Content\n\n#### Step 1: Initialize the Starting Point\n- **Function Definition**: The solution begins by defining a function , which accepts a string and a markup list. The goal of this function is to convert the given plain text into an HTML-rendered version using predefined start and end positions and corresponding HTML tags.\n- **Expected Output**: An expected output string is predefined to validate the correctness of the implementation. The comparison of the actual and expected outputs is used to verify the solution.\n\n#### Step 2: Create a Mapping\n- **Mapping Structure**: Develop a mapping () from indices to tags by iterating over the  list.\n- **Comprehensive For-Loop**: \n  - A  loop iterates through the  array to extract start indices, end indices, and associated HTML tags.\n  - **Extraction and Population**: For every entry, check whether a start or end entry already exists in the map. If not, initialize an empty array and push tags enclosed within HTML brackets into these arrays.\n\n#### Step 3: Construct and Modify String List\n- **String Parsing**: Convert the input string into a manipulable list (). This involves:\n  - Iterating through each character of the string.\n  - Removing spaces while ensuring the overall positional integrity by handling spaces separately, i.e., appending directly to the following characters.\n- **Console Verification**: Output at this stage is console-logged to ensure the string list reflects the expected character arrangement without unwanted spaces.\n\n#### Step 4: Build the HTML Output\n- **Variable Initialization**: An empty string  is initialized to start constructing the final output.\n- **Iterative Concatenation**: Using a  loop:\n  - Iterate over  and concatenate tags from  appropriately.\n  - Handle cases where specific map indices might not exist, thereby only adding character content from .\n\n#### Step 5: Handling Closing Tags\n- **Post-Loop Closure**: Ensure closure of tags that might extend beyond the last index in . Append any remaining closing tags from .\n- **Map and Index Adjustments**: Add logic to manage intermediary tags within the string - effectively push and unshift HTML tags based upon dynamic conditions in map-indices versus markup indices comparisons.\n  \n#### Step 6: Result Verification and Debugging\n- **Result Comparison**: After constructing the , validate against the expected output string.\n- **Completion Criteria**: Ensure that the parsed string matches the predefined expected result.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Transformation Map**: Utilize a map-like structure to systematically manage HTML tags placement according to specified start and end indices.\n- **Iterative Modifications**: Employ for-loops combined with conditional constructs to manage the transformation and construction processes.\n- **String Handling Precision**: Demonstrate proficiency in manipulating strings effectively within the constraints of HTML formatting.\n- **Debugging and Validation**: Importance of continuous validation through console outputs and final result comparisons to capture and rectify logical errors.\n- **Complex Indexed Wraps**: Handle overlapping tag scenarios intricately by managing order and correctness of output through refined conditions.",
