  "content": "## Video Overview\n\nThe video elaborates on the design of a web crawler, a prevalent system design problem often encountered in interviews at leading tech companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Evan, a former staff engineer at Meta and co-founder of Hello Interview, leads viewers through the comprehensive process of web crawler design, drawing from his extensive experience conducting over 50 system design interviews. The tutorial spans multiple facets of system design, from defining core requirements to detailed High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD), culminating in strategies for addressing edge cases and optimizing system performance.\n\n## Table of Contents\n1.

In this context, the web crawler will:\n- Start with a predefined set of seed URLs.\n- Traverse and collect text data for various applications, such as training large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's models.\n- Operate within a five-day time constraint, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness while addressing web etiquette through policies such as politeness.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- **Functional Requirements**:\n  - The ability to initiate crawling from seed URLs and extract relevant text data.\n  - Efficient management of previously visited URLs to avoid duplication.\n\n- **Non-functional Requirements**:\n  - Scalability to handle up to 10 billion pages, accommodating spikes in web traffic.\n  - High efficiency to complete crawling within the designated five-day timeframe.\n  - Fault tolerance to handle network issues or unresponsive pages while ensuring data integrity.\n  - Compliance with web standards, such as the Robots.txt file, which dictates how web crawlers should interact with the site.\n\n## High-Level Design (HLD)\n\n### Core Entities and System Interface\n- **Core Entities**: \n  - **Crawled Data**: The output consists of the extracted text from web pages.\n  - **URL Metadata**: Information regarding the URLs processed, such as timestamp, status, and extraction results.\n  - **Domain Metadata**: Information related to the domain from which URLs are retrieved, including domain priority and crawl frequency.\n\n- **System Interface**:\n  - **Inputs**: Seed URLs that provide the starting point for crawling.\n  - **Outputs**: A structured repository of text data and associated metadata for downstream processing.\n\n### Data Flow Analysis\n1. **Seed URL Management**: Store the seed URLs in a message queue (e.g., Kafka or Amazon SQS).\n2. **URL Processing**: Worker nodes will continuously pull URLs from the queue:\n   - **Fetching**: Use DNS resolution to obtain the page content.\n   - **Data Extraction**: Parse the HTML to obtain text and store it in structured formats.\n3. **Storage**: Save the extracted textual data in a scalable blob storage solution, such as AWS S3, while requeuing any new URLs found during the crawling process.\n\n### Scalability and Efficiency\nThe architecture should allow for horizontal scaling as the number of worker nodes can be adjusted based on load. Employ load balancing techniques to optimize resource usage effectively. \n\n## Detailed Low-Level Design (LLD)\n\n### Component Breakdown\n1. **Frontier Queue**: This component manages the URLs ready to be processed, ensuring no duplicates and prioritizing based on timestamp and domain policies.\n2. **Crawler Workers**:\n   - Fetch URL content.\n   - Extract text data and save it to blob storage.\n   - Push newly discovered URLs back into the queue for processing.\n3. **Blob Storage**: Long-term viable storage for the crawled data, allowing for easy retrieval and further processing.\n4. **Database**: Utilized for tracking URL states (e.g., NEW, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED) and associated metadata, helping ensure continuity and preventing duplicate crawls.\n\n### Fault Tolerance Strategies\n- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement intelligent retries for failed fetch attempts, incorporating exponential backoff strategies to avoid overwhelming the target servers.\n- **Checkpoints**: Regularly log progress and statuses to facilitate recovery in case of system failures.\n- **State Management**: Store the process state and enable rollbacks if necessary to maintain resilience.\n\n### Security and Compliance",
