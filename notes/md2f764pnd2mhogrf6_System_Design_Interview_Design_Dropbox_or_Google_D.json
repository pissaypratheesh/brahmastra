[Excalidraw Used in the Video](https://link.excalidraw.com/l/56zGeHiLyKZ/311OFRZkAkz)\n\n### Video Overview\n\nThis video presents a deep dive into a frequently asked system design interview question for designing Dropbox or Google Drive, particularly common in interviews at major technology companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta. Evan, a former Meta Staff Engineer and co-founder of Hello Interview, acts as your guide, offering an intricate walk-through of the problem with insights from his extensive interviewing experience. The video dissects the entire process—from defining requirements, outlining core entities and APIs, to drafting a high-level design, and finally performing in-depth analysis to ensure scalability and fault tolerance in the proposed system.\n\n### Detailed Technical Content\n\n#### System Design Roadmap\n\n**1. Defining Requirements:**\n\n- **Functional Requirements:** These refer to the core functionalities the system must support. For Dropbox:\n  - ***File Upload/Download:*** Users should be able to upload files to a remote storage server and download them to any device. \n  - ***Automatic Syncing:*** The system must seamlessly sync files across multiple devices.\n\n- **Non-Functional Requirements:** These determine the quality attributes of the system such as:\n  - ***Scalability:*** Must support a large user base and vast amounts of data.\n  - ***Availability vs. Consistency (CAP Theorem):*** Led by Partition Tolerance, the system prioritizes availability over strict consistency, accepting eventual consistency in exchange for always being able to access files.\n  - ***Low Latency:*** Uploads and downloads should have minimal delay—crucial for user satisfaction.\n  - ***Large File Support with Resumable Uploads:*** Necessary to enable the handling of files as large as 50GB, allowing for pickup in case of connection interruption.\n  - ***High Data Integrity:*** Ensures that file sync is both accurate and reliable.\n\n**2. Core Entities and APIs:**\n\n- **Core Entities:**\n  - **File:** Represents the actual file data and includes metadata. Stored in a system like AWS S3 that can handle blob storage.\n  - **File Metadata:** Captures metadata such as file ID, name, type, size, owner ID, and a direct link to the file storage location.\n  - **User:** Represents the user base interacting with Dropbox, managing data access and permissions.\n\n- **APIs:**\n  - **POST /files:** Uploads a file along with its metadata. On completion, returns a success status.\n  - **GET /files/{fileId}:** Fetches a file based on a unique file ID, returning its data and metadata.\n  - **GET /changes?timestamp={timestamp}:** Retrieves a list of files changed since the last specified timestamp for syncing purposes.\n\n**3. High-Level Design (HLD):**\n\n- **Architecture Layout:**\n  - **Client:** Initiates the file upload and download processes, with the request passing through a load balancer.\n  - **API Gateway:** Handles middleware concerns such as authentication, SSL termination, and routing in a microservices setup.\n\n- **Service Responsibilities:**\n  - **File Service:** Manages files by interfacing with the blob storage for uploads and downloads.\n  - **Blob Storage (e.g., AWS S3):** Used for storing raw file data. Optimizes large blob storage cost-effectively.\n  - **File Metadata Storage:** Handles all metadata related to files, typically stored in a scalable, manageably indexed database like MySQL or Postgres.\n\n- **Data Flow:**\n  - **Upload Process:** Client sends a request to API Gateway, which forwards it to the File Service, stores raw data in Blob Storage, and writes metadata to the Metadata DB.\n  - **Download Process:** Metadata DB fetches the metadata needed to access the file stored in Blob Storage, providing the client with direct access.\n\n**4. Deep Design Exploration:**\n\n- **Scalability & Performance Optimization:**\n  - Employ strategies like sharding for the metadata database to manage extensive data distribution efficiently.\n  - Implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for rapid file access, reducing latency.\n\n- **Concurrency Control:**\n  - Ensures that simultaneous upload attempts do not conflict, possibly employing techniques like optimistic concurrency.\n\n- **Security Concerns:**\n  - API security managed through JWT tokens or session-based auth to ensure file access is authenticated and authorized.\n\n- **Failure Handling:**\n  - Design incorporates mechanisms for retries in the event of network failure or sudden service unavailability.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Approach Framework:** Establish a clear roadmap for addressing system design tasks by detailing requirements and then gradually building up through entities, APIs, and scalable designs.\n\n2. **Scalability Trade-offs:** Understand and navigate the critical trade-offs between availability and consistency, particularly in distributed systems reliant on large-scale storage and real-time syncing features.\n\n3. **Evolving Designs:** Keep designs flexible—initial API outlines often evolve with further architectural understanding, necessitating backward adaptations and more complex designs.\n\n4. **Communication Is Key:** Continuously clarify design choices, especially in trade-off scenarios like those highlighted by the CAP theorem, to predictably guide system behavior under varying operational conditions.\n\nThis comprehensive documentation captures the detailed and nuanced approach needed for high-stakes system design interviews at top tech companies, serving as both a preparation aide and a detailed reference guide.",
