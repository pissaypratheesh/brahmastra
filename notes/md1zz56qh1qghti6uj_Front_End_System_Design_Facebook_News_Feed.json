  "content": "### Filtered Resources (Technical Links Only)\n\n- Telegram: https://t.me/frontend_engineer_blog\n- Medium: https://evgeniiray.medium.com/\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgenii-ray/\n\n---\n\n### Video Overview\n\nThe video is an introductory segment in a series focusing on frontend system design, specifically addressing the design challenges of the Facebook News Feed. The aim is to break down the design process into manageable steps, encompassing general requirements, component architecture, data entities, infinite scrolling, and optimization among others. The content targets frontend engineers, especially given the scarcity of focused resources for frontend system designs compared to backend. Moreover, the session teases apart the drawing of dependency graphs, API handling strategies, and specifically addresses performance optimization and accessibility.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Technical Content\n\n**1. General Requirements**\n\n- **Feature Objective**: To develop an infinite scrollable news feed where stories manifest based on user subscriptions, like groups or friend updates.\n- **Sharing & Attachment**: Users need the ability to share, comment, and attach multimedia (links, images, videos) to stories, ensuring vibrant, engaging interactions.\n\n**2. Specific Requirements and Accessibility**\n\n- **Device Support**: The application must be accessible across a broad spectrum of devices, highlighting adaptability to different platforms.\n- **Accessibility**: Needs to cater to users with disabilities, such as implementing accessibility features that enhance user engagement for those with visual impairments.\n\n**3. Component Architecture**\n\n- **Story Component**: Each story encompasses elements like avatar, title, date, textual content, images, and controls (e.g., comment, share).\n- **Dependency Graphs**: Using a dependency graph to track data flow and understand component interconnections enables better modular analysis and component reuse.\n  \n**4. Data Entities and API Design**\n\n- **Data Structure**: Designing scalable data entities using Typescript notation to define types like Story, Comment, Media, etc., focusing on elements such as ID, user origin, date, and content.\n- **API Considerations**: \n  - REST vs GraphQL: Evaluation suggests REST for its scalability by leveraging HTTP's caching; however, GraphQL offers agility in querying data fields.\n  - API Endpoints: Detailed endpoints like `getPosts`, `createPost`, and `createComment` are structured, aiming for precise data handling and segregation.\n\n**5. Frontend Data Storage**\n\n- **Storage Optimization**: Data should be stored in a flattened, normalized structure for efficient access and manipulation, avoiding nested structures to reduce complexity.\n- **Data Fetching Points**: Strategic architectural points for fetching data ensure efficiency, leveraging stored cursor positions for incremental loads.\n\n**6. Infinite Scroll Implementation**\n\n- **Intersection Observers**: Utilizing browser APIs like Intersection Observer to detect page end and dynamically load more content without interrupting user interaction.\n- **Sliding Window**: Implementing a sliding window mechanism to ensure only a fixed number of DOM nodes is rendered, enhancing performance by dynamically adding/removing nodes based on scroll position.\n\n**7. Scalability and Failover Strategies**\n\n- **Load Balancing**: Server Side Events (SSEs) preferred over Long Polling for its efficiency in managing load, benefiting from HTTP/2's advanced protocol features.\n- **Failover Handling**: Assessment of long latency positions and fallback strategies (e.g., caching mechanisms) to maintain application fluidity during high loads.\n\n**8. Performance Optimization**\n\n- **Network Performance**: \n  - **Asset Optimization**: Use Brotli or gzip compressions and serve images in newer formats like WebP for supported browsers.\n  - **CDN Utilization**: Local caching and geo-location delivery to expedite asset loading.\n  - **HTTP/2 Protocol**: Embracing multiplexing to allow concurrent data loading, cutting down on initial loading time.\n\n- **Rendering and JavaScript Performance**:\n  - Offer server-side rendering for initial page loads to reduce Time to First Byte (TTFB).\n  - Defer non-essential scripts and use caching strategies to alleviate workload on the main thread.\n\n**9. Accessibility Strategies**\n\n- **Color Blindness Support**: Implement contrasting color schemes adaptable for users with color vision deficiency.\n- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Ensure all interactive elements are equipped with appropriate aria-labels for enhanced navigation.\n  \n**10. Advanced Features**\n\n- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Mode**: Enable offline access through service workers, caching story data proactively for scenarios like airplane mode access.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Systematic Design Approach**: Breaking down the problem into core segments enables manageable development and clearer interface standards.\n- **Cross-disciplinary Considerations**: Blending frontend demands with backend capacities (like API design and server management) is crucial.\n- **Scalability and Performance**: Prioritizing both resource efficiency (through caching and HTTP/2) and user experience (through design patterns like infinite scroll) books a smoother client-side operation.\n- **Continual Optimization**: Regular assessments and adjustments as new methodologies and tools become available are vital for maintaining a competitive and functional product.\n- **Community Engagement**: Encouraging feedback for continuous improvement demonstrates a commitment to evolving designs consistent with peer development and current needs.",
